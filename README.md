# Python-for-Spike-Prime
These are some basic programs that are useful if you are building and programming the LEGO SPIKE PRIME.
We use this code for competing in the FLL. If there are any bugs or you have any questions please notify us.
We strongly recommend that you use VS Code for your programming, the instructions for doing so are below.
You can however also paste this into the SPIKE or MINDSTORMS software.

## Necessary extensions/Programs for use in VS Code:
Visual Studio Code
Python
Lego Spike Prime/Mindstorms Robot Inventor Extension by Peter Staev

## Fully charged battery voltage
When the battery is fully charged the voltage is 8300.

## How to connect:
Click the button LEGO Hub: Disconnected on the left hand side of the blue bottom bar. 
A dropdown menu will open at the top of the screen, try out all the COM options it gives you until you are connected.
Note: You have to have previously connected to the hub in the Spike or Mindstorms software first.

## How to upload a program to the hub:
Press CTRL SHIFT P and select LEGO Hub: upload program from the dropdown menu.
Choose Python: regular.
Choose the slot you want the program to be saved in on the hub.

## How to start a program:
Press CTRL + SHIFT + P and select LEGO Hub: start program from the dropdown menu.
Select the slot of the program you want to start on the hub.
Note: This step can be skipped if you have autostart activated.

## How to enable preocompiling:
To precompile the main.py on the PC go to the extension page and select the extension
then click on the settings symbol and activate Lego Spike Prime Mindstorms: Compile Before Upload.
This will allow the program to start faster
